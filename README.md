#  Word Search Game
This is a React Native application that implements a word search game. In the game, the player has to form words using a set of randomly generated letters displayed in a grid. The player can select letters by tapping on them in the grid, and the selected letters are highlighted. Once the player forms a valid word, the score is updated and the selected letters are cleared from the grid.

# Getting started
To run the application, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. You also need to have the Expo CLI installed, which you can install globally by running:

```bash 
  npm install -g expo-cli
  git clone https://github.com/Furkangunduz/words.git
  cd  words
  npm install
  npm run start
```
